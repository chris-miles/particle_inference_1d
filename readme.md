- Figure 2 (an example simulation): `make_example_sim.m`
- Figure 3: generated by `sweep_N_inference.m`, second half after the inference
  - Note that this file runs the inference and then generate the analytical figures, so if you just want the latter, skip to the last plotting sections
- Figure 4: `fisher_info.m` 
  - Run time on this is quite long (~5 minutes) but can be made shorter by taking coarser grids for `muvals`, `zvals` or `sigmavals`
- Figure 5:  generated by `sweep_N_inference.m` and `sweep_L_inference.m`. 
- Figure 6AB: generated by `fisher_info.m` 
- Figure 6C:  
  - first need to do inference in various scenarios, can be done by `postarea_both.m`  
  - once the various `.mat` files are populated plots comparing the posterior areas can be generated by `plot_postareas.m` 
  - Inset curves showing $\sigma_L$ and $\sigma_z$ effect can be generated by `plot_pdfs_randsrc.m` 
- Figure S1: generated at the end of `sweep_N_inference.m`
